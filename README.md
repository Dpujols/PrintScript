# PrintScript

The project is very simple upon completion both versions should:
  * Install any missing printers listed in Devices.txt
  * Avoid attempting to install any printers already on the system
  * Install/Update Papercut 
  * Both scripts should require little to no shell interaction from users - just a click and run. 
 
 ## As of 4/4/21 The windows version is ready for pre-implementation testing and accomplishes all goals.
  
 ## As of 6/2/21 The MAC version is somewhat finished with printer installation functional. However printer checking has not yet been implemented. 

### TODO:
  * Windows: This version is confirmed to work locally, however id like to do some testing from server side to make sure its working              correctly. 
  * MAC: This version is successfully adding printers, however progress has stopped until papercut is updated.
