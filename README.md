# PrintScript

The project is very simple upon completion both versions should:
  * Install any missing printers listed in Devices.txt
  * Avoid attempting to install any printers already on the system
  * Install/Update Papercut 
  * Both scripts should require little to no shell interaction from users - just a click and run. 
  
The initial version for windows begins as 0.2, 0.1 was very inefficient and made calls to the server without needing.
